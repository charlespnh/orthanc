**Orthanc** is one of the *palant√≠ri* stones in The Lord of The Rings, leveraged by its keeper to see other parts of the word and thus gain valuable intelligence. The project is developed with similar purpose of providing intelligence on routing and navigation. The project also serves as a sequel to https://github.com/charlespnh/Recreational-Algorithmic-Project-II, but with completely different architecture design as well as new programming languages, frameworks and database.

## Queries
$1.$ Given a list of $n$ 2D-coordinated points $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ with weight function $dist(p_i, p_j)$ satisfying Euclidean metric, find the optimal cycle through all $n$ points such that its total length is $min \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j \neq i,j=1}^n dist(p_i, p_j)$

$2.$ Given a point $p$, find all *neighbour* $q$ such that $dist(p,q) \leq K$ for some const. $K$

First query asks for the Euclidean Traveling Salesman tour that minimizes the total cost. The second query is simply a Nearest Neighbour problem, asking to find nearest points within some radius $K$. Both problems are solvable, although how to answer those queries efficiently in the real world can start to get a lot more interesting

Query $2$ looks easy enough: Given the fixed point $p$ of interest with longitude and latitude, simply do a linear scan of all $n$ points that satisfy the distance condition. A geospatial database query would look like so:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM geo_table AS gt
WHERE ST_DISTANCE(p, ST_POINT(gt.lon, gt.lat)) < K
```

In the context of database, this gets quite expensive as you have to go though potentially millions of all entries in the table, whereas the idea of having database in the first place is having these entries indexed to avoid scanning and thus fast look-up. 

But with **H3** geospatial index system, by 'hexagonifying' Earth's surface and thus bucketing points into hexagons, the query above can be improved. Assuming the database schema is changed to introduce an <code>h3</code> column as additional indexed column, we can now refine the SQL query like so:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM geo_table AS gt
WHERE gt.h3 = hex 
    AND ST_DISTANCE(p, ST_POINT(gt.lon, gt.lat)) < 10
```

Note: A lot have been simplified... The devil is in the details, and <code>services/queries.js</code> and https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/h3/ have them details


## Query the Stars

The idea can be somewhat generalized from the two-dimensional Earch's surface to three-dimension of the infinite universe. 

Longitude and latitude is a grid coordinate system that works only with spherical geometry. Interesting enough, the observable universe, where recorded data of celestial bodies can only lie within, is ever-expanding at the speed of light and in a way can be seen as a sphere.

However, solar systems, stars, galaxies, black holes, nebula, quasars, ..., lie within as opposed to on the surface of this sphere. There's additional dimension of infinite depth involved when locating the celestial bodies. But when observing from any fixed location in the universe, it's almost impossible to make much sense of depth, i.e. closer and further objects are indistinguishable in distance. As such, our previous coordinate system can now be applied.

In the context of astronomy, *right ascension (RA)* and *declination (DEC)* are used instead, but the principle is very much the same as with longitude and latitude, respectively. For instance, Vega star has same $39^o$ decliniation as latitude of many cities (e.g. Lisbon, Washington D.C, ...). With the Earth rotating, once a day at each of such cities, Vega star will be right above them.
